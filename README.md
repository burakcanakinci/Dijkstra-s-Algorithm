# MapNavigator
The Map Navigator project based on data structures and algorithms is an advanced mapping application that utilizes an improved version of Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the shortest route between two points on a map.
In this project, the map is initially visualized as a graph, with each place acting as a node and the distance between them as an edge. The graph is then subjected to Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the shortest route between the two points.
As it moves along the graph, the algorithm continuously updates the distances it has tentatively assigned to each site on the map. The computer then chooses the site with the shortest tentative distance and examines the areas around it, adjusting the tentative distances of those areas as necessary. This step is repeated by the algorithm until it reaches the desired place, and the shortest path is found.
## Problem Statement ##
There exist many advanced navigation systems but most of them are unable to provide routes precisely as well as information of buildings within a region such as campuses, shopping malls, hospitals and etc.
Nowadays, as people are getting more and more connected to technology, they lost their human touch. Also, people feel more convenient to search for the problem themselves rather than asking someone for help.  
An informative, reliable, and precise guidance system is very important in this technological era. It should be able to navigate the user no matter whether the user is in an indoor or outdoor environment. The guidance system must be user-friendly and able to process data efficiently.
Since the size of any college/university campus can vary from 30 acres to anywhere around 200 acres, students spend the majority of their time traveling between different buildings. New students feel inconvenient to search their way inside the campus.
Therefore, a navigation system is required to find the optimal path within the campus and for the aforementioned problem.
